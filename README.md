# Medical Charges Prediction and Analysis 

# About the Dataset

This dataset is dedicated to the cost of treatment of different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age and so on. There is no data on the diagnosis of patients. But other information is available that can help us to make a conclusion about the health of patients and practice regression analysis. 


# Columns
•	age: age of primary beneficiary
•	sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
•	bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
•	children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
•	smoker: Smoking
•	region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
•	charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

# Use case tasks (for directions purpose only):
•	How is the distribution of various properties based on gender?
•	Perform hypothesis testing to check whether having children more children results in the fact that people smoke less?
•	Which variable do you think effect the charges the most and why (prove it).
•	What can you say about the difference in distribution of charges for smokers and non smokers.
•	How is BMI affecting the distribution of charges.
•	Plot the region wise distribution of charges based on other variables and draw the insights.
•	Make a well performing model predicting the charges based on the various other variables.  


# System design tasks (for directions purpose only):
•	Design system architecture to deploy this Regression ML Model in production
•	How do you perform canary build?
•	What should be the strategy for ML Model Monitoring?
•	How do you perform load and stress testing?
•	How do you track, monitor and audit ML training?
•	Design framework for continuous delivery and automation of machine learning tasks.
